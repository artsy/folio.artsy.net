    - quote: 'Artsy Folio is an invaluable tool at fairs and away from the gallery, allowing us to review an artistâ€™s work efficiently but intimately, and making requests for information and pricing a snap.'

    - quote: 'As with all other parts of Artsy, the clean visual design and intuitive interface are complementary to the art and do not distract from or complicate the viewing experience.'
